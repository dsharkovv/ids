        "The below commands create a grid search using PyTorch on the two-class version of NSL-KDD.",
        "The grid search is performed with two classifiers - one with one layer and 100 hidden units",
        "and one with two layers, the first with 200 hidden units and the second - with 300.",
        "Three different values are tested for weight decay and two for learning rate.",
        "The learning rate is set to be reduced by 50% every if no improvement is observed after 10 epochs",
        "A second command changes the dataset to two-class, but with PCA and trains an autoencoder.",
        "A third command changes the dataset to five-class and trains a classifier with a stacked autoencoder",
        "The autoencoder has early stopping enabled with a waiting period of 20 epochs. It is important",
        "to note that the stacked autoencoder takes parameters as lists, where the number of elements",
        "is either one or it equals the number of layers. If one value is given, it will be used",
        "for all of the autoencoders that the stacked atoencoder consists of."
